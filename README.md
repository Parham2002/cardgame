This is my card game in terminal project.

A card is taken out of a randomly generated and shuffled deck for each player once it is their turn.
If the last two cards contain the same symbol, the player on that turn is granted the opportunity to type "SNAP" within three seconds to win the game. Inputting the
wrong input or taking longer than three seconds to do so will result in failure of the player.

If I could improve this project I would:
- add exceptions for wrong inputs submitted by the user
- add and pass some tests
- make the code tidier/more efficient
- add more comments

Technologies and methods used:
- Java
- Git
- Classes
- Methods
- Arrays
- Getters/setters
- Scanner
- Conditional statements
- Encapsulation
